    <h3><em>You came for a Filthy Burger and you're gonna get one.</em> This burger comes in swinging. Loaded with bacon-onion jam, diced dill pickles, all cushioned between two sesame-seed milk buns. Heaven looks quite filthy.</h3>

    <h5>for the bacon-onion jam (required):</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb slab of bacon, sliced into lardons</li>
            <li>2 cups(4 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4lbs of onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>for the burger:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3lbs fresh ground brisket</li>
            <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup diced kosher dill pickles</li>
            <li>1 cup Hellmann's mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1lb Monterey Jack cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 sesame-seed milk buns</li>
            <li>shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Time to cook:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the bacon-onion jam: In a large heavy-bottomed pot set over medium, render the bacon. Add the butter and onions. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, 1 ½ hours. Cooking the onions this slowly will let them caramelize naturally in their sugars. Add the vinegar and sugar to the pot and cook 15 minutes, then remove from the heat. Let cool and place in container and store in the refrigerator. (When you make the P&L Burgers, you can warm some of this jam in a pan.)</li>
            <li>Make the burger: Place cast-iron skillet over medium heat 5 minutes before cooking the patties. Roll 6-ounce|170 gram burger balls from the brisket and pat them into flat, thick patties, about 1-inch (2.5-cm) thick. Season the patties with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the pickles and mayonnaise; set aside. Place three patties in the skillet (with no oil). The fat will render and you will have a juicier burger from the natural fat inside the patty. Cook 4 minutes on one side, then flip.</li>
            <li>Top each patty with the jam and then put 2 slices of cheese per patty on top. Pour 2 tablespoons water into the skillet, covering it immediately so the burgers can steam. Remove the lid after 45 seconds. The cheese should be fully melted.</li>
            <li>Butter the buns and place them face-down in another skillet over medium- high so they get nice and toasty.</li>
            <li>Spoon the pickle mayo on the bottom buns, then add a good pile of the lettuce. Add the cheesy beef patties, cover with more of the pickle mayo, then add bun tops. Just eat the f****** burger.</li>
        </ol>
