        <h4><em>This Apple Dessert Pizza is a quick dessert that everyone loves! Pizza crust, apple pie filling, crumble topping and a sweet icing drizzle.</em></h4>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 premade thin pizza crust</li>
            <li>1 can apple pie filling</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons salted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>⅔ cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons milk</li>
        </ul>
    <H3>Directions:</H3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Take crust out of package and place on round baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Open your can of pie filling and get in there with a sharp knife and pull the knife back and forth across the apples. This will chop them up and give you more apple filling across your whole pizza.</li>
            <li>Spread the apple pie filling evenly on the pizza crust.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine softened butter, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon until crumbly. You can use a fork, a pastry cutter or your hands to do this.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the crumb topping all over the apple filling.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 25-30 minutes, until heated through and crumb topping is slightly browned.</li>
            <li>While pizza is cooling, start making the icing. Whisk together powdered sugar and milk. Add milk slowly until you get the consistency you like. Drizzle icing all across pizza.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp pizza cutter, slice up your pizza and serve!</li>
        </ol>
    <h5><em>BOOM!</em> You've successfully made your pizza pie! Enjoy!</h5>
